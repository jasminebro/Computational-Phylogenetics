#Assignment Two 

#1. Write a function that multiplies all consecutively decreasing numbers
#max and min are supplied as arguments

from functools import reduce 
#reduce allows me to apply a function of two arguments and the values are reduced to a single value
import operator
#lets me use standard operations as function ex.operator.add(x,y)=x+y

def multiple (min,max):
#I am creating a function to interate over a range of values and return one value
    x= reduce(operator.mul, range(min,max+1))
    #I am using reduce to give me one value in this range. operator.mul will multiply
    #the values in the range. +1 is added to max to make sure the max number is included
    return x
         
example=multiple(2,10)
#here is an example of how to input values and call my "multiple" function

print example     

#2. write a function that calculates the binomial coefficient 2 ways using the function from #1   
#2a. use the n!/(n-k)!k! OR n(n-1)...(n-k+1)/k!

def BiCoefficient(n,k): 
    if k>n:
        return 0
    else:
    #note that n should be your max value and k the min. you want to see how many sets are in the larger
        return multiple(n, 1)/(multiple(n-k, 1)*multiple(k, 1))

example2a=BiCoefficient(10,2)
print example2a

#2b Now lets use the other equation to calulate the binomial coefficient 
#n*n-1/k

#Note: I think I may have something wrong with the equation above...the value is 4 off from the 2nd equation
#I also tried this equation (n*n-1)/k and it's 4 off not sure why 
def BiCoefficient2(n,k):
    if k>n:
        return 0
    else: 
        return multiple(n, n-k+1)/multiple(k,1)
    
example2b=BiCoefficient2 (10,2)
print example2b

#3. Now I'm going to use both functions on large values and see what happens
#I tried both of these and the first equation took longer than the 2nd

#4. Use (2b) to write a function that calculates the probability of 
#k successes in n Bernoulli trials with probability p. 
#This is called the Binomial(n,p) distribution. 
def Bernoulli(k,n,p): 
    ProbMassFunction= BiCoefficient2(n, k)*pow(p,k)*pow((1-p),(n-k))
    
    return ProbMassFunction 
    
#5 Now write a function to sample from an arbitrary discrete distribution. 
#This function should take two arguments. 
#The first is a list of arbitrarily labeled events and the second is a list of 
#probabilities associated with these events.


def DiscreteDistr(events,probabilities):
    #you need to import random to get arbritrary random numbers generated
    import random
    x= random.choice(events)
    #this pulls a random number from a list 
    #the lists must be the same length and I should use the lists index to match
    #events with its proper probability 
    index=events.index(x)
    #this indexes the random events 
    probability=probabilities[index]
    #this is the probabilities of the events given 
    
    return "this is the event", x, "and this is the probability", probability
    
eventlist=["j","a","s","m","i","n","e"]
problist=[.4,.5,.6,.7,.3,.2,.1]

print DiscreteDistr(eventlist,problist)
